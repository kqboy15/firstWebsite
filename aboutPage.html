            <p class="text">In this paragraph I will enlighten you a little more of why my breed is so awesome!
                And maybe some other breeds of cats that are pretty cool. I am a great cat for first time owner!
                To learn more about me in those aspects click <a href="https://www.purina.co.uk/find-a-pet/cat-breeds/ragdoll" target="_blank" class="linkPage">here!</a>
                One reason why my breed is so cool is that we are so soft and have a lot of fur. If there aren't enough pictures of me here, click <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/search/images?k=ragdoll%20cat"
                target="_blank" class="linkPage">here</a>
                to see some other cute ragdoll cats!
            </p>

            <p class="text">Quick stretch and yawn break... <i>hmm mom made dinner... time to</i> <b>FEAST!</b></p>

            <p class="text">Ok, back to it! Now, if you are very allergic to cats I would not recommend myself to you. Instead, let me give you some
                alternative options to a ragdoll that are still cute, but won't hurt your allergies. Take a look <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/general-health/hypoallergenic-cat-breeds" target="_blank"
                class="linkPage">here</a>
                in order to see some of the top breeds that are hypoallergenic! Now at this point I would assume you would want a ragdoll... but
                in the case you don't have allergies and you may not be good enough for us... here are some options of other cute fluffy cats!
                Why don't you go ahead and click <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/fluffy-cat-breeds-7692786" target="_blank" class="linkPage">here</a> <i>I know you saw that ragdoll on the list.</i>
                Anywaysss, I feel like this is enough learning for now. Thank you for reading and meow for now.
