            <h2 class="heading2">My Travels</h2>

            <p class="text">
                In my 1 year of life, I have traveled all over with my parents.<br>
                We have been to 6 states! I have become a pro on roadtrips and airplanes...
                Even though all I do is sleep haha.<br>
                To see some of pictures of traveling or even just of me, head to my <a href="picturePage.html" class="linkText">pictures</a> page!

            <h2 class="heading2">Fun Stuff</h2>

            <p class="text">
                I also have set up a <a href="surveyPage.html" class="linkText">survey</a> on my website!<br>
                I want to know how many of you guys have a cute kid like me, and what you think of cats.<br>
                (I say I am a kid, but my parents know that I actually own them, because I get
                whatever I want when I want it...)<br>
                I may be spoiled, but that's how it should be.
